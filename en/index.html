                                In April 2008, he entered the University of Tokyo, Natural Sciences. In March 2012, he graduated from the department of physics at the same university. He advanced to the master course of the Graduate School of Comprehensive Culture and obtained his master's degree from the study of thermodynamic and statistical mechanics properties of long-range interaction systems. 
While studying at the same doctoral degree, he met Bitcoin which gradually drew his attention to its theoretical novelty and innovation.
He started the development and operation of a Monacoin (Japan's first bitcoin clone (altcoin)) exchange in January 2014, and since then has developed various other services such as a mining pool, wallet and so, all by himself. After that, with the expansion of his business, he launched Janom where he resides as the representative. Janom provides technical consulting, system development, technology offerings related to cryptocurrencies.
